## Project 03: Monopoly

For the monopoly part i chose Node.js and Javascript. I focused on creating Object types that were independent and injectable to make testing easier. In javascript it is pretty easy to mock objects since you can overwrite most members (functions and properties) of an object, so i focused on mocking for my tests. I covered about 70-80% of my code, leaving out some functions with only 1 or 2 lines of code.

The test results for my monopoly implementation:
